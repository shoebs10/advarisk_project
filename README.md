The get_url function is designed to scrape data from the ePanjiyan website (https://epanjiyan.rajasthan.gov.in), specifically for retrieving document-related information.
This function performs a series of web requests and selections based on parameters such as location type, district, tehsil, SRO (Sub-Registrar Office), document type, and document number which can be passed from an input.xlsx (Excel) file.
It retrieves data and compiles it into a structured pandas DataFrame, which can be used for further processing or export.
The function simulates interactions with a web page by sending HTTP requests, processing HTML responses, and using form data to select options at various levels (location, district, tehsil, SRO, document type).
The function also handles CAPTCHA verification during the scraping process.

Detailed Steps
Session Setup: A new session is created using requests.Session() to maintain cookies and headers between requests.

Request Sequence: The function follows a sequence of requests to the ePanjiyan website, each request interacting with specific web forms (location type, district, tehsil, SRO, document type, etc.). Each form submission is done by sending HTTP POST requests with the necessary parameters.

ViewState & EventValidation: During each request, the function extracts and updates special fields (__VIEWSTATE, __VIEWSTATEGENERATOR, and __EVENTVALIDATION) from the HTML response, which are necessary for proper form submission.

CAPTCHA Handling: If a CAPTCHA is encountered during the process, the function fetches the CAPTCHA image, solves it using the captcha_function, and resubmits the form with the correct CAPTCHA text.

Data Scraping: The function scrapes tabular data from the ePanjiyan website's search results. It extracts rows of information into a DataFrame, which is then appended to a list.

Pagination: The function handles pagination and continues scraping until all available pages are processed (maximum of 3 pages).

Merging and Structuring Data: After scraping data from all pages, the DataFrames are merged, and relevant metadata (location type, district, tehsil, SRO, etc.) is added to the DataFrame. The columns are reordered for easy analysis.

Return Data: The final DataFrame containing all the scraped data is returned.

- **MongoDB Integration**: Inserts the merged data into a MongoDB database (`advarisk` collection, `epanjiyan` database).
- **Excel Export**: Saves the extracted data into an Excel file with the current date.
